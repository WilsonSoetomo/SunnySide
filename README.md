./weather/weathersc.png

website is displayed with a search bar containing mutiple city histories beneath it. When city buttons are pressed commands are given to function to input into the api to search for that cities state.

css is styled minimally

I made the website as light as i could for easier loading.

The visitor is prompted by the website for location access to display the current weather conditions in their location. data is displayed on load of the page.

for loops are used to create the 5 days weather forecast and the creation of buttons based on the number of objects stored in the local storage.

icons are imported from the api website with more apis that display the weather.

weather time is displayed with the date now function.

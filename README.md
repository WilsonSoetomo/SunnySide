**Wilson's Wacky Weather Website** is a fast and lightweight weather app that provides real-time weather updates for your current location and any city you search for!

## üî• Features:
- **Real-Time Weather**: The website prompts visitors for location access to instantly display the current weather conditions.
- **City Search History**: Search for cities, and your recent searches are saved as buttons for quick access to past weather checks.
- **5-Day Forecast**: A clean, minimal design powered by for loops generates a 5-day weather forecast, ensuring all the details you need at a glance.
- **Dynamic Icons**: Beautiful weather icons are fetched directly from the weather API, adding a visual touch to the forecast.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: I kept the CSS minimal and optimized the site for faster loading, so you'll get your weather updates without the wait.

## üöÄ How It Works:
- When the site loads, it prompts for location access to display your current weather.
- Use the search bar to look up weather for any city! Previously searched cities are stored and displayed beneath the search bar for easy access.
- Weather data and time are fetched using APIs and JavaScript's `Date.now()` function for accuracy.
- For loops are used to dynamically create forecast cards and city buttons based on your search history.
